# Design Patterns 🎨

**Design Patterns** are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They are templates that can be applied to real-world scenarios to create maintainable and scalable code.

---

## 1. What is a Design Pattern? 🤔
A **design pattern** is a reusable solution to a frequently occurring problem within a given context in software design. It’s **not a finished code**, but a template for how to solve a problem.

---

## 2. Design Pattern vs. Algorithm ⚖️
| **Design Pattern** 🧩 | **Algorithm** 🧮 |
|-----------------------|------------------|
| High-level description of a solution. | Step-by-step instructions to solve a problem. |
| Focuses on object interaction and responsibilities. | Focuses on computational efficiency and correctness. |
| Language-agnostic and conceptual. | Often tied to specific data structures and logic. |

## 3. Why Use Design Patterns? 🚀
- ✅ **Tried and tested**: Proven solutions by expert developers.
- ✅ **Promotes OOD principles**: Encourages clean, modular, and reusable code.
- ✅ **Common vocabulary**: Simplifies communication between developers.

## 4. When to Use Design Patterns? ⏰
- **Avoid over-engineering**: Use only when necessary (e.g., for complex object creation or interaction).
- **Project context**: Adapt patterns to your project’s size, timeline, and team expertise.
- **Don’t force it**: A simpler solution may be better for small-scale problems.

## 5. Classifications of Design Patterns 📂

### 🛠️ **Creational Patterns** (Object Creation)
![Creational](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Creational-blue)
> Focus on flexible and reusable object creation mechanisms.

- **Singleton** 🔒: Ensures a class has only one instance.
- **Factory Method** 🏭: Creates objects without specifying the exact class.
- **Abstract Factory** 🏗️: Produces families of related objects.
- **Builder** 👷: Constructs complex objects step-by-step.
- **Prototype** 🖨️: Clones existing objects to create new ones.

---

### 🏛️ **Structural Patterns** (Object Composition)
![Structural](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Structural-green)
> Simplify how objects/classes are structured and composed.

- **Adapter** 🔌: Allows incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
- **Bridge** 🌉: Separates abstraction from implementation.
- **Composite** 🌳: Treats individual and group objects uniformly.
- **Decorator** 🎀: Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects.
- **Facade** 🏢: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
- **Flyweight** 🐜: Shares objects to reduce memory usage.
- **Proxy** 🛡️: Acts as a placeholder for another object.

---

### 🔄 **Behavioral Patterns** (Object Interaction)
![Behavioral](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Behavioral-orange)
> Manage communication, responsibilities, and workflows between objects.

- **Chain of Responsibility** ⛓️: Passes requests along a chain of handlers.
- **Command** 📜: Encapsulates a request as an object.
- **Iterator** 🔄: Traverses elements of a collection.
- **Mediator** 🗣️: Reduces direct dependencies between objects.
- **Memento** 📒: Captures and restores an object’s internal state.
- **Observer** 👀: Notifies objects of state changes.
- **State** 🌦️: Alters object behavior when its state changes.
- **Strategy** 🎯: Defines a family of interchangeable algorithms.
- **Template Method** 📝: Defines a skeleton of an algorithm.
- **Visitor** 🚶: Adds operations to objects without changing their classes.

## 6. Key Takeaways 💡
- **Not a silver bullet**: Use patterns judiciously.
- **Learn by doing**: Practice implementing patterns in real projects.
- **Combine patterns**: Many systems use multiple patterns together.
